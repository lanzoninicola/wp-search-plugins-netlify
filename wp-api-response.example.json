Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.</p>\n<p>Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Membership and Default WordPress Forms</h4>\n<p>Aside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">membership sites</a>.</p>\n<p>For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricted to logged-in users only.</p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.</p>\n<p>Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testimonials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.</p>\n<h4>Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More</h4>\n<p>While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful custom forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, mobile form, and basically any type of custom form you need.</p>\n<p>WPForms integrates with both PayPal, Stripe, Square, and Authorize.Net so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you&#8217;re using SSL, then you can use our Stripe, Square, or Authorize.Net Payment forms to accept credit card payments directly on your website. Alternatively you can use our PayPal payment form to make a donation form and accept payments online.</p>\n<p>Aside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shirt order forms, online booking forms, and more.</p>\n<p>We understand that sometimes you may need to create a contact form that require a signature. WPForms comes with a signature field to collect user signature on your WordPress forms or even create custom signature forms.</p>\n<p>You can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that&#8217;s loved by over 5 million users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am so impressed with this plugin. I decided to give it a shot over some of the other form plugins, and I am so glad I did. It works well, is so easy to use and customize. The support is amazing on top of it all. I got the pro version because I was so pleased. Highly recommend.<br />\n  Micky73 &#8211; WordPress user</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results</h4>\n<p>With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-pages-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See Form Pages Demo</a>).</p>\n<p>To improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout. Our conversational forms are similar to Typeform without the high subscription costs (<a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/conversational-forms-addon/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See Conversational Forms Demo</a>).</p>\n<p>WPForms also has other conversion optimization features such as our smart form logic that lets you create dynamic contact forms where fields change based on user&#8217;s answer, multi-page contact forms with progress bar, and other advanced contact forms.</p>\n<p>WPForms form analytics integration with MonsterInsights allow you to easily track your lead capture forms, newsletter signup forms, request a quote contact form, and other important forms on your site.</p>\n<h4>Easy to Customize and Extend</h4>\n<p>You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and custom CSS.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using Elementor or Divi page builders our native integrations let you quickly customize the style of your forms. Embedding forms in Elementor and Divi has never been easier.</p>\n<p>We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend simple contact forms further. That&#8217;s why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.</p>\n<p>Since contact forms are essential for marketing, WPForms is a must have plugin for every website!</p>\n<h4>Full WPForms Feature List</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/drag-drop-online-form-builder/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Online Form Builder</a> &#8211; Our powerful drag &amp; drop contact form builder allows you to easily create WordPress contact forms and other online forms in just a few minutes without writing any code.</li>\n<li>100% Responsive &#8211; Mobile Friendly contact forms.</li>\n<li>GDPR Friendly &#8211; Make your contact form GDPR compatible with just a few clicks.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/form-templates/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Form Templates</a> &#8211; Use our pre-built form templates to save time.

The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules.</p>\n<p>In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has online features provided by QUIC.cloud for Image Optimization, CSS Optimization and Low Quality Image Placeholder services. When one of those optimizations are requested, data is transmitted to a remote QUIC.cloud server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. Now if using the QUIC.cloud CDN it uses LSCache technologies to access your site then host your site to others globally and also your data is not transferred to or accessed by QUIC.cloud employees in any way, except as necessary in providing maintenance or technical support. QUIC.cloud keeps copies of that data for up to 7 days and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to LiteSpeed so that we may better provide technical support. None of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data are involved.</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://quic.cloud/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">QUIC.cloud Privacy Policy</a> for our complete Privacy/GDPR statement.</p>\n",

      "description": "<h3>WordPress Mail SMTP Plugin</h3>\n<p>Having problems with your WordPress site not sending emails? You&#8217;re not alone. Over 2 million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send their emails reliably.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to make email deliverability easy and reliable. We want to ensure your emails reach the inbox.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.</p>\n<p>Best of all, our easy-to-use Setup Wizard and detailed documentation guide you through the process.</p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?</h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by using authentication.</p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and Zoho are in a constant battle with email spammers. One of the things they look at is if an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.</p>\n<p>If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, then emails either go in the SPAM folder or worst, don&#8217;t get delivered at all.</p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WPForms</a>.</p>\n<p>The issue is that most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WordPress hosting companies</a> don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.</p>\n<p>The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.</p>\n<h4>How does WP Mail SMTP work?</h4>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by improving and changing how your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()</code> function to either use proper SMTP host credentials or leverage a built-in SMTP mail provider.</p>\n<p>When using one of our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. This means even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails still send successfully.</p>\n<p>This helps you fix all <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/wordpress-not-sending-email/\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WordPress not sending email</a> issues.</p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP setup options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SendLayer <strong>(#1 Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Sendinblue SMTP <strong>(Recommended)</strong></li>\n<li>Mailgun SMTP</li>\n<li>SendGrid SMTP</li>\n<li>Postmark SMTP</li>\n<li>SparkPost SMTP</li>\n<li>Gmail SMTP (Gmail, Google Workspace, G Suite)</li>\n<li>Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Amazon SES SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>Zoho Mail SMTP <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">[Pro]</a></li>\n<li>All Other SMTP</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For most options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails.</p>\n<p>Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one. This is what makes WP Mail SMTP, the best SMTP solution for WordPress.</p>\n<h4>SendLayer</h4>\n<p>SendLayer is our #1 recommended transactional email service.</p>\n<p>Its affordable pricing and simple setup make it the perfect choice for sending emails from WordPress.

No problem, turn it off.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Multisite Network Settings</h4>\n<p>For users running a multisite network, our network settings provide a centralized location to easily configure your SMTP settings for all sites, saving you time.</p>\n<h3>Expert Support</h3>\n<p>We provide <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-mail-smtp-support-policy/\">limited support</a> for the WP Mail SMTP plugin on the WordPress.org forums. Access to our world class one-on-one email support is available to <a href=\"https://wpmailsmtp.com/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WP Mail SMTP Pro</a> users.</p>\n<h4>White Glove Setup</h4>\n<p>Our White Glove Setup service is a great option that anyone can benefit from. Whether you don&#8217;t have the time or maybe you feel a bit in over your head &#8211; we&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>\n<p>You can sit back and relax while we set up everything for you. White glove setup includes WP Mail SMTP plugin installation and setup, configuration adjustments to your DNS for proper email domain name verification, SMTP.com or Mailgun setup, and final testing to confirm everything is passing with flying colors.</p>\n<h3>Security</h3>\n<p>The WP Mail SMTP team takes security very seriously. Not only does the plugin follow all security best practices, but we have several options available to ensure your site is safe and secure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Direct SMTP mailer integrations (recommended), such as SMTP.com, Sendinblue, Mailgun, SendGrid, Postmark and SparkPost, use the official provider APIs. This means you never enter your username or password in the plugin settings and these credentials are not stored in the database. Instead, we use tokens or API keys which are much more secure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When using Other SMTP mailer, we provide the option to insert your password in your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, so it&#8217;s not visible in your WordPress settings or saved in the database.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Credits</h3>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin was originally created by Callum Macdonald.

It lets you to continue to use the familiar TinyMCE editor for most tasks, and at the same time gives you full access to all blocks and new features in the block editor.</p>\n<p>Version 5.5 continues to improve and enhance the new features introduced in version 5.0 of the plugin.

If you prefer to have access to both editors side by side or to allow your users to switch editors, it would be better to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a>. Advanced Editor Tools is fully compatible with the classic editor plugin and similar plugins that restore use of the previous WordPress editor.</p>\n<p>As always this plugin will let you add, remove and arrange the buttons that are shown on the Visual Editor toolbar in the Classic Paragraph and Classic blocks in the block editor, and in the classic editor (when enabled by a plugin). There you can configure up to four rows of buttons including Font Sizes, Font Family, text and background colors, tables, etc.</p>\n<p>It includes 15 plugins for <a href=\"https://www.tiny.cloud/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TinyMCE</a> that are automatically enabled or disabled depending on the buttons you have chosen.<br />\nIn addition this plugin adds options for keeping the paragraph tags in text mode and importing the CSS classes from the theme&#8217;s editor-style.css.</p>\n<h4>Some of the features added by this plugin</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Classic Paragraph&#8221; block that can be used instead of or together with the standard Paragraph block.</li>\n<li>An option to set the Classic Paragraph or Classic block as the default block in the block editor.</li>\n<li>Supports converting of most default blocks to classic paragraphs, and from classic paragraphs back to the default blocks.</li>\n<li>Support for creating and editing tables in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>More options when inserting lists in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>Search and Replace in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>Ability to set Font Family and Font Sizes in the Classic blocks and the classic editor.</li>\n<li>And many others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Privacy</h4>\n<p>Advanced Editor Tools does not collect or store any user related data. It does not set cookies, and it does not connect to any third-party websites.

      "description": "<p>Redirection is the most popular redirect manager for WordPress. With it you can easily manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This can help reduce errors and improve your site ranking.</p>\n<p>Redirection is designed to be used on sites with a few redirects to sites with thousands of redirects.</p>\n<p>It has been a WordPress plugin for over 10 years and has been recommended countless times. And it&#8217;s free!</p>\n<p>Full documentation can be found at <a href=\"https://redirection.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://redirection.me</a></p>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with PHP from 5.6 to 8.1.</p>\n<h4>Redirect manager</h4>\n<p>Create and manage redirects quickly and easily without needing Apache or Nginx knowledge. If your WordPress supports permalinks then you can use Redirection to redirect any URL.</p>\n<p>There is full support for regular expressions so you can create redirect patterns to match any number of URLs. You can match query parameters and even pass them through to the target URL.</p>\n<p>The plugin can also be configured to monitor when post or page permalinks are changed and automatically create a redirect to the new URL.</p>\n<h4>Conditional redirects</h4>\n<p>In addition to straightforward URL matching you can redirect based on other conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login status &#8211; redirect only if the user is logged in or logged out</li>\n<li>WordPress capability &#8211; redirect if the user is able to perform a certain capability</li>\n<li>Browser &#8211; redirect if the user is using a certain browser</li>\n<li>Referrer &#8211; redirect if the user visited the link from another page</li>\n<li>Cookies &#8211; redirect if a particular cookie is set</li>\n<li>HTTP headers &#8211; redirect based on a HTTP header</li>\n<li>Custom filter &#8211; redirect based on your own WordPress filter</li>\n<li>IP address &#8211; redirect if the client IP address matches</li>\n<li>Server &#8211; redirect another domain if also hosted on this server</li>\n<li>Page type &#8211; redirect if the current page is a 404</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Full logging</h4>\n<p>A configurable logging option allows to view all redirects occurring on your site, including information about the visitor, the browser used, and the referrer. A &#8216;hit&#8217; count is maintained for each redirect so you can see if a URL is being used.</p>\n<p>Logs can be exported for external viewing, and can be searched and filtered for more detailed investigation.</p>\n<p>Display geographic information about an IP address, as well as a full user agent information, to try and understand who the visitor is.</p>\n<p>You are able to disable or reduce IP collection to meet the legal requirements of your geographic region, and can change the amount of information captured from the bare minimum to HTTP headers.</p>\n<p>You can also log any redirect happening on your site, including those performed outside of Redirection.</p>\n<h4>Add HTTP headers</h4>\n<p>HTTP headers can be added to redirects or your entire site that help reduce the impact of redirects or help increase security. You can also add your own custom headers.</p>\n<h4>Track 404 errors</h4>\n<p>Redirection will keep track of all 404 errors that occur on your site, allowing you to track down and fix problems.</p>\n<p>Errors can be grouped to show where you should focus your attention, and can be redirected in bulk.</p>\n<h4>Query parameter handling</h4>\n<p>You can match query parameters exactly, ignore them, and even pass them through to your target.</p>\n<h4>Migrate Permalinks</h4>\n<p>Changed your permalink structure? You can migrate old permalinks simply by entering the old permalink structure. Multiple migrations are supported.</p>\n<h4>Apache &amp; Nginx support</h4>\n<p>By default Redirection will manage all redirects using WordPress. However you can configure it so redirects are automatically saved to a .htaccess file and handled by Apache itself.</p>\n<p>If you use Nginx then you can export redirects to an Nginx rewrite rules file.</p>\n<h4>Fine-grained permissions</h4>\n<p>Fine-grained permissions are available so you can customise the plugin for different users. This makes it particularly suitable for client sites where you may want to prevent certain actions, and remove functionality.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export</h4>\n<p>The plugin has a fully-featured import and export system and you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import and export to Apache .htaccess</li>\n<li>Export to Nginx rewrite rules</li>\n<li>Copy redirects between sites using JSON</li>\n<li>Import and export to CSV for viewing in a spreadsheet</li>\n<li>Use WP CLI to automate import and export</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also import from the following plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple 301 Redirects</li>\n<li>SEO Redirection</li>\n<li>Safe Redirect Manager</li>\n<li>Rank Math</li>\n<li>WordPress old slug redirects</li>\n<li>Quick Post/Pages redirects</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Search Regex compatible</h4>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with <a href=\"https://searchregex.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Search Regex</a>, allowing you to bulk update your redirects.</p>\n<h4>Wait, it&#8217;s free?</h4>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s really free. There&#8217;s no premium version and no need to pay money to get access to features. This is a dedicated redirect management plugin.</p>\n<h3>Support</h3>\n<p>Please submit bugs, patches, and feature requests to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/johngodley/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://github.com/johngodley/redirection</a></p>\n<p>Please submit translations to:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/redirection</a></p>\n",
